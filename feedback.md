## You have something else to say ?

Before submitting your final work, tell us what you think about these different topics:

**Note**: It is totally **OK** for you to not have any feedback. We simply wanted to give a space for anyone who feels that this process can be improved and we are happy to hear it. Also, there are no right/wrong answers !

**_1 - How do you feel about the workload that was necessary to complete the mini project ? Would you say it was too much or too little ?_**

__The workload was quite high but that's because you have to look for different resources like icons and fonts. Afterwards I was on vacation and I worked in an unorganized way. My bad!__

**_2 - How would you change this exam and/or examination process?_**

__I think that we must put free resources for the integration of the ux model and that we can directly start the integration very quickly.__


***Improvement***

*Technical*
- upgrade Angular version (it's better to follow the new features)
- manage compatibility with dependencies (upgrade version)
- add prettier to format project files
- architecture of project (core, features, shared...)
- project configuration (path, index.ts...)
- use Bootstrap
- add and use Bootstrap Icons
- implementation of ux design model

***To be improved***

*Technical*
- remove unused dependencies for improve build performance (no time)
- use svg into project instead png to improve performance (no time)
- use Cypress.io for end-to-end testing (no time)
- test coverage of unit tests, it's partially done (no time and only on the important parts)

*UX*
- may be optimized space between head and content of the page (better access to the information)
- implement custom infinite scroll with pagination (no time and questionable)
- use svg and optimize styles (no time)
