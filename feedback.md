**Note**: It is totally **OK** for you to not have any feedback. We simply wanted to give a space for anyone who feels that this process can be improved and we are happy to hear it. Also, there are no right/wrong answers !

**_1 - How do you feel about the workload that was necessary to complete the mini project ? Would you say it was too much or too little ?_**

__The workload was quite high but that's because you have to look for different resources like icons and fonts. Afterwards I was on vacation and I worked in an unorganized way. My bad!__

**_2 - How would you change this exam and/or examination process?_**

__I think that we must put free resources for the integration of the ux model and that we can directly start the integration very quickly.__
